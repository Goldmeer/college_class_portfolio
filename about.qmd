# About Me

My name is **Joseph Goldmeer**, and this website serves as my academic portfolio for college-level mathematics and other coursework. I built this site using **Quarto**, **R/Python**, and **GitHub Pages**.

Here you will find:

- Class assignments  
- Projects & visualizations  
- Notes and study guides  
- Computational demos  

This portfolio will grow as I complete more courses.
